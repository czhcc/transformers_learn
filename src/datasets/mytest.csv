163740	Mirtazapine	Depression	"""I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me."""	10.0	February 28, 2012	22
206473	Mesalamine	Crohn's Disease, Maintenance	"""My son has Crohn&#039;s disease and has done very well on the Asacol.  He has no complaints and shows no side effects.  He has taken as many as nine tablets per day at one time.  I&#039;ve been very happy with the results, reducing his bouts of diarrhea drastically."""	8.0	May 17, 2009	17

39293	Contrave	Weight Loss	"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave."""	9.0	March 5, 2017	35
97768	Cyclafem 1 / 35	Birth Control	"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend"""	9.0	October 22, 2015	4

215892	Copper	Birth Control	"""I&#039;ve had the copper coil for about 3 months now. I was really excited at the thought of not taking hormones. I&#039;m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn&#039;t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I&#039;m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I&#039;m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I&#039;d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn&#039;t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn&#039;t for me"""	6.0	June 6, 2016	1

I am at 3 mgs and really starting to feel the withdraw.I don&#039;t plan to get my next 30 doses.because its almost rediculous how little it does for me. I have 3 does doses of 3 mg and Im terrified. Can anyone give me some truthful encouragement?....."""	7.0	October 18, 2016	21
71428	Levora	Birth Control	"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz."""	2.0	April 16, 2011	3
196802	Paroxetine	Hot Flashes	"""Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking Brisdelle for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START.

213376	Nuvigil	Narcolepsy	"""A doctor in the ER prescribed me 200 mg of Provigil when I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy. It didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me at all. Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day. But if I went out somewhere I would be able to come home and take a nap and be fully awake again. Taking that with Xyrem makes me feel 98%..not quite 100, but still pretty great."""	9.0	June 30, 2010	14

33173	Microgestin Fe 1 / 20	Acne	"""So I was on Ginanvi for about 3 months before I switched over to this pill due to the high cost of Ginavi (I don&#039;t have insurance). Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It&#039;s time for me to switch."""	3.0	June 22, 2017	1

231397	Trazodone	Insomnia	"""If I could give it a 0, I would absolutely do so.  Started at 50mg, and felt WIRED.  Wanted to get up and clean the house!  Bumped it to 100mg, less wired, but still wide awake all night.  Bumped to 150, with the same lack of effect.  MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.  At it&#039;s low price point, feel free to give it a try, and maybe you will be luckier?  Everyone&#039;s sleep conditions are different.  But if you get hyper after benadryl, expect the same reaction to this drug."""	1.0	October 18, 2016	15
38116	EnteraGam	Irritable Bowel Syndrome	"""I am so happy with the samples provided by my Endocrinologist. The only thing I am so sad about is that I cannot afford the prohibitive costs.

I was skeptic since I&#039;ve previously tried botox, iontophoresis and drysol with limited results. However, after three days of taking oxybutynin (5mg 3x a day) I was 95% sweat-free. My only negative things to say about the drug is about side effects. I have gotten fairly dizzy/spaced out a few times, and I experience dry mouth pretty often. However, that&#039;s not bad in comparison to the acne I&#039;ve gotten. I used to get pimples around once a month, however now I have ones lasting for &lt;6 wks, varying in size/colour. I constantly have groups of acne on my face. Does anyone have any remedies? I&#039;ve tried acne masks, cleansers and tea tree oil."""	9.0	May 30, 2017	10

Folks, Doctors NEED to be using SCIENCE to treat illnesses, not giving out random prescriptions for 2+ medications for 1 illness. If your Doctor is not doing monthly blood tests AT LEAST to see how the medications are affecting your body chemistry and serotonin levels, then you need to fire the Doctor and find one who does do his/her job the right way, and who is good at the science part of the job.

But the Dr though it was time for me to get off the antibiotics. I&#039;ve been on Soolantra for about 6 months and my face has never looked better. I&#039;m thrilled with everything about it.

Because of this, I did think it tasted quite gross.  It had a strange grape salty flavor but it was only 16 oz, so it wasn&#039;t too bad to get down.  I had absolutely no discomfort or nausea.

I thought movantik worked on the backed up s**t but it stops the opioid from working. Of course you will have diarrhea when your pain meds are cut off.
